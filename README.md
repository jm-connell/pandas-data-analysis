# Overview

As a software engineer, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. This project is an exploration into data analysis using Python and pandas. The data set I am analyzing is the NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Crash data, which can be found [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95).

The purpose of this software is to provide insights into the data set based on user input. Users can choose to analyze data based on different criteria such as day of the week, month, time, borough, zip code, and vehicle type. They can also choose to see the safest or most dangerous results based on the number of collisions.

# Data Analysis Results

The main questions I wanted to answer with this project was "What are the most safe and most dangerous days, times, and vehicle types?". I added a couple more categories based on the information provided by the data set.

# Development Environment

This software was developed using Visual Studio Code. The programming language used is Python, with the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

# Useful Websites

- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [NYC Vehicle Collisions Dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)

# Future Work

- Improve user input validation to handle more edge cases.
- Add more detailed error messages for better user experience.
- Expand the analysis capabilities to include more data types and criteria.
